<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I’m Anika! After pivoting my career toward Data Analytics, I’ve found a real passion for digging into datasets and making sense of the patterns behind them. 
Whether it’s SQL queries, a Tableau dashboard, or Python scripts, I love the process of turning raw numbers into stories that matter.</p>

<p>I’m especially excited about using analytics to solve real-world business problems—helping companies not only see what’s happening but also why and what to do next. Right now,
I’m looking for full-time or remote opportunities as a Data Analyst where I can grow, contribute, and make an impact.</p>
